Hi, Anton Ovchinnikov here! 
=======
I'm 31 y.o. designer and junior web-developer.

Ð¡ontact me by email: *toxadesign@gmail.com* or telegram: *@av0vchinnikov*.

I would like to work on a cool product, and then come up with and launch my own projects. 
I am productive, disciplined and motivated. I approach my work responsibly. 
In my previous job, I single-handedly supervised orders for large clients, such as Gazprom, the Hermitage.
He built all communication with the client and convinced him to make the right decisions. 
I have been working as a graphic designer for 7 years, the last few years I have been interested in web design and development.
At the moment, I am implementing [this site](http://www.rostec-sertifikat.ru/). In this project, for the first time,
I did the entire layout of the project and transferred it to 1C-Bitrix having studied it in a short time.


**Code example:**

```const markMass = 92;
const markHeight=1.76;
const johnMass=92;
const johnHeight=1.76;

const markBMI = markMass/markHeight**2;
const johnBMI = johnMass/johnHeight**2;

let markJohnCompere = markBMI>johnBMI;
console.log(markBMI, johnBMI);
console.log(markJohnCompere);

if(markBMI>johnBMI){
    console.log(`Mark BMI is bigger than John`);
} if(markBMI==johnBMI){
    console.log(`Mark and John BMI is equal`);
} 
else{
    console.log(`John BMI is biggest than Mark`)
}
```
